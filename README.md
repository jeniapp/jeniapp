# Assignment b4

## Description
The assignment is to enhance the web site you implemented in the previous assignment (b3) with Bootstrap in order to show the web site on small display (e.g., your cell phone).

## Directory Hierarchy:
```
/Library/WebServer/Documents
|--  AwardBio.pdf
|--  index.html             # Main page of the website

## Features
- Single Page Application (SPA): The site behaves like a SPA using the history API and JavaScript to dynamically load content without full page reloads.
- Responsive Design: Bootstrap ensures the website works on mobile devices.
- Pagination: The Web Programming section is split into three pages using a custom pagination system.
- Browser History: Users can navigate back and forth between different sections using the browserâ€™s back/forward buttons.
